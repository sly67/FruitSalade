FruitSalade User Guide (Updated)

Getting Started
FruitSalade provides on-demand file synchronization with placeholder support.
Files appear in your filesystem immediately but content is only downloaded when
you actually open or read a file. Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS clients.

How It Works
The FUSE client mounts a virtual filesystem that shows all your files from the
server. When you run 'ls', only metadata is fetched - no content is transferred.
When you 'cat' or open a file, the content is fetched from storage and cached.

Caching
Downloaded files are cached locally using an LRU strategy. The cache has a
configurable maximum size. When the cache is full, the least recently used files
are evicted to make room for new downloads. You can pin important files to
prevent eviction.

Pinning
Use the pin command to mark files as always-available offline:
  fruitsalade pin /path/to/important-file.txt

Offline Mode
If the server becomes unavailable, cached files remain accessible. The client
will automatically reconnect and refresh metadata when the server comes back.
Pinned files are always available regardless of connectivity.

Conflict Resolution
When two devices edit the same file simultaneously, FruitSalade creates a
conflict copy named "filename (conflict YYYY-MM-DD).ext". Use the web UI
to compare and resolve conflicts.
